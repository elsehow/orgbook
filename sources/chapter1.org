also appear in the "Biliography" section at the end of the document.


Repeated references should be shortened cite:nietzsche,hegel.

# TODO - figure with caption and label.

You can reference figures (Figure *XXX*).

Figures and images can also go in the margin.[fn:2] 
* Footnotes
[fn:2] TODO figure in the margin

[fn:1] This is a numbered margin note. Unnumbered margin notes are also
supported with the somewhat cumbersome syntax =[[mn:1][My unnumbered margin
note.]]=. This syntax isn't very "org-y" to me, but I see the appeal of not
having a number.
